# Neutral

Neutral is a library for building data heavy applications on a credibly neutral, highly scalable, distributed backend.

Existing servers are centralised and can arbitrarily withhold service, give false responses, or drop your data.<br/>
Blockchains, on the other hand are credibly neutral but have low very data scalability.<br/>
Neutral clusters are a middleground with almost as much scalability as traditional servers, and almost as much credible neutrality of blockchains.<br/>

Many applications that would benefit from neutrality tend to be data constrained. 
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Google Search - all of these exert enormous power over our society in a fairly unaccountable way.
It would probably be better if they acted purely neutrally, lest they become a nexus of power, and potential corruption and control far more profound than the totalitarianism of the 20th century.
Power comes from monopoly.
Tech monopolies tend to have come from network effects and data moats.
Any neutral [hyperstructure] wanting to replace them needs extreme data scaling.

Twitter happens to both be extremely politically powerful and be the easiest to recreate technically.
If Twitter were Neutral, anyone could cheaply post, and that every post could be found by anyone.

As detailed in the [roadmap], there are three phases to building Neutral:
    - Build a credibly neutral Twitter clone with a single server.
    - Build out the cluster as the relevant technology becomes available (namely efficient recursive proofs).
    - Build developer tooling to generalise to arbitrary use cases
