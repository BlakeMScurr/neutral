These state channels are special case of those described by https://statechannels.org/.

Anyone can force a new channel open with any server.
Money goes from client to server.
The server can be slashed on a stake separate to the channel's money.
The client can close the channel and withdraw money at any time.
The server cannot close the channel, but can withdraw money at any time.
The client can force the server to respond for requests.
