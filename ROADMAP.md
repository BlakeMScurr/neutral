# Roadmap

## Social Media Server

### Testing

    - Single server operated by the Neutral team
    - Onchain forcing
    - Bundle level queries
    - UI

### Mainnet

    - Server level monetisation
    - Actual value at stake

The server has credible neutrality, in that it can't practically censor users without breaking L1.
Also, it can be implemented today with existing technology.
However, it is centralised and vulnerable to attacks (e.g., by competitors or censorious governments).

## Social Media Cluster

    - Restaking
    - Recursive whole state queries
    - Leadership selection
    - Protocol monetisation

The cluster is a bona fide hyperstructure.
It relies on restaking and contract verified recursive proofs, neither of which are currently mature.
It only addresses social media.

## Cluster Library

    - API for cluster rules
    - Developer ecosystem for verifiable SaaS

Any market that would traditionally be addressed by SaaS can be addressed by a Neutral cluster.
